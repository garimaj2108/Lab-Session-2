My final link shows two data visualizations.
The first visualization shows records lost in last 5 years and the trends in all industries for the breaches.

The second data visualization refutes the claim that other industries had more data breaches than tech.

First Iteration:

The first iteration wasn't very clear on what it was representing. There were way too many bars and visuaization was not readable.
